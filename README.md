	BINARY TREE

A binary tree is a type of tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The binary tree consists of nodes connected by edges. The topmost node of the tree is called the root.

In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children, but it can also have fewer children. The left child is typically smaller than the parent node, and the right child is usually larger. This property is known as the binary search tree property, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

The structure of a binary tree facilitates various operations and algorithms. Traversing a binary tree can be done in several ways, including in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal. These traversal techniques allow you to visit each node of the tree in a specific order.

In-Order Traversal:
In in-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the current node, and finally the right subtree. This traversal method visits the nodes of the binary tree in ascending order when applied to a binary search tree.

Pre-Order Traversal:
In pre-order traversal, the current node is visited first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree. This traversal method is useful in creating a copy of the tree and is often used to export a tree structure.

Post-Order Traversal:
In post-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, then the right subtree, and finally the current node. This traversal method is commonly used in deleting or freeing the nodes of the tree.

Binary trees have numerous applications, such as in representing hierarchical structures like file systems, organizing data for efficient searching, implementing priority queues, and forming the basis of more complex data structures like binary heaps and binary search trees.
